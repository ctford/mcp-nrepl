## Creative Constraint: AI-Assisted Development

MCP-nREPL is developed under a creative constraint: **all code is written by Claude Code**, not by hand. This means I may not be able to accept traditional pull requests in the usual way.

**However**, I'm still very interested in seeing PRs that prove out concepts! If you have an implementation idea:
- Feel free to submit a PR demonstrating the concept
- I'll review it and may work with Claude Code to incorporate similar changes
- Think of PRs as detailed, executable proposals rather than code I'll merge directly

I'm still figuring out what this constraint means for collaboration, so bear with me as we explore this together.

## Design Constraints

MCP-nREPL follows strict design constraints:
- **Zero dependencies** - Only Babashka built-ins, no external libraries
- **REPL access only** - Provides access to nREPL, doesn't add functionality beyond that
- **Minimal, fast, and readable** - Clean code that's easy to understand and performs well

Thank you for understanding this unusual approach to development!
